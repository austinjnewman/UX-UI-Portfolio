# UX & UI Portfolio
My collection of work in the UX Research and Design field, including paper protoyping, iterated wireframes, and flowcharts. Additionally, there are UI mockup examples currently in progress, including an interface for a game, with versions tested in Coblis for colorblindness accessibility. While many concepts are transferrable throughout various applications of UX R&D, this portfolio pertains specifically to the video game field.
